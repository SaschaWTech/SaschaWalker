Enjoy Cyber Security, I sure do! Hello there, I am Sascha Walker, I graduated with a Bachelors and my major was Cyber Operations, with a minor in Digital Forensics. I also achieved certification in CompTIAâ€™s Security+ and Pentest+. I will be talking about my journey in cyber security, and sometimes any other miscellaneous topics that I think deserve interest.
